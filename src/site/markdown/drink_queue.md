Drink Management System
 
This site provides a structured approach to handling beverages using seven Java classes:
 
Drink forms the base structure.
Liquid represents individual components.
SimpleDrink manages single-ingredient beverages.
Cocktail handles multi-ingredient drinks.
DrinkQueue organizes drinks systematically.
StringQueue manages textual data.
IQueue ensures queue functionality.
 
The system enables precise volume and alcohol percentage calculations, as well as efficient storage and retrieval of drink data.
Let me know if further modifications are needed.
